# Good Practices for Software Development


#### Which point(s) were new to you?
Two of the mentioned points were new to me:
- **Use of GitHub Gist, CodePen or Sandbox:** I knew about GitHub gist but didn't know that it can be a nice way to share code snippets. Also, I learned about SandBox and CodePen as well.
- **Time Tracking with Boosted App:** I didn't know about this app. This will be very helpful to keep the track of the time to increase productivity. 

#### Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?
The areas I need to improve are:
- **Asking for clarity when requirements are vague:** I often hesitate when it comes to asking questions for clarity when the requirement aren't clear.
- **Not picking up call/informing:** When I am unable to pickup call for whatever reasons. I often do not pick up call and inform as I am afraid as how the caller might respond.
- **Bad at making notes:** When it comes to making notes while everyone's discussing a topic, I often don't make proper notes, which later leaves me struggling with clarifications.
