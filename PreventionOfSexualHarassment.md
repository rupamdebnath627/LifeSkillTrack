# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

#### What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?
Behaviours that are considered as sexual harassment can be broadly categorized into three categories:
- **Physical:** This type of harassment includes:
    - Impeding or blocking women's movement.
    - Inappropriate touching such as hugging, kissing, patting, stroking, rubbing.
    - Sexual gesturing, leering or straring.
- **Visual:** This type of harassment includes: 
    - Posters, drawings, pictures or screen savers, cartoons or text of sexual nature.
- **Verbal:** This type of harassment includes: 
    - Comments about someone's clothing.
    - A person's body
    - Sexual or gender based jokes or remarks.
    - Requesting sexual favours or repeatedly asking a person out.
    - Sexual innuendos.
    - Threats
    - Spreading rumours about someone's personal or sexual life.
    - Using foul or obscene language.


#### What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?
If I were to ever witness such kind of incidents ever, I will take these four measures:
- Tell the harasser that the abusive behavior is unwelcome and ask the individual(s) to stop.
- Keep a record of incidents (date, times, locations, possible witnesses, what happened, your response etc.)
- If, after asking the harasser to stop the abusive behavior, the harassment continues, report
the incident in writing to ICC member.
- If circumstances warrant it, file a charge of assault with the police.
