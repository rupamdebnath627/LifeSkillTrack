## 4. Types of Communication
**When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day to day life?**  
I use passive communication when I don't feel it's worth my time to give my thought and get into endless arguments with people who won't pay attention to whatever I say.

**When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day to day life?**  
I get aggresive when someone delibrately commits mistakes despite of him/her being aware of the correct way which in turn affects someone else badly but not them.

**When do you switch into Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day to day life?**  
I do it usually when I am with my friends and they done something which has annoyed me. This is the easiest way to tell them that I am annoyed but don't wish to escalate the situation.

**How can you make your communication assertive? You can watch and analyse the videos, then think what would be a few steps you can apply in your own life?**  
First, would to modulate my voice so that I sound assertive in the first place. Secound, would be to focus on giving crisp and clear instruction to show that I am serious. Also, when negation something I would say no gracefully so as to avoid confrontration.
