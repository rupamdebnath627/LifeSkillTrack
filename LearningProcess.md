## 2. Learning How to Learn TED talk by Barbara Oakley

#### In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The most interesting thing I found in this video are the two modes thinking which are focused mode and diffused mode. When you are to deep dive into something you already know you go into focused mode. And when you are trying to learn something completely, and you got stuck somewhere new go into diffused mode. You distance yourself from the intricacies of the problem and focus on the main topics.

#### What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
The two modes thinking are focused mode and diffused mode. When you are to deep dive into something you already know you go into focused mode. And when you are trying to learn something completely, and you got stuck somewhere new go into diffused mode. You distance yourself from the intricacies of the problem and focus on the main topics.

The video outlines four steps to take when approaching a new topic to learn it quickly:
- Deconstruct the skill

#### What are some actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?
Going forward to improve my learning I will follow these steps:
- First, I will try to simplify the topics that I want to learn as much as possible.
- Then, I will try to learn the art of switching from focused and diffused mode based on previous knowledge about the topic.
- I will create an environment around me so that I can fully focus on the topic that I am trying to learn that includes removing anything that can distract me like messages, social media notifications, etc.
- I will practice whatever I learned for at least 20 hours.
