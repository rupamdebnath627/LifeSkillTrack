## 1. Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg

#### In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The most interesting thing I found in this video is that the speaker tells us that instead of focus on a large outcome focus on the tiny habits that you can develop that will eventually lead to that outcome.

## 2. Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message

#### How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.?
MAP stands for Motivation, Ability and Prompt. These three things play an essential role to develop new habits. Without motivation, you won't have the purpose to develop the habit. Without ability, you won't be able to perform the actions required for your habit. And prompt means the trigger to start performing that habit.

#### Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?
Here, shine refers to as taking pride of actions when you complete you tiny habits that you have developed. Without it, your habit will quickly feel like a burden whenever you try performing your routine tiny habits. Just like you celebrate when you accomplish and achieve something big, you should celebrate similarly when you accomplish completing you tiny habit too.

#### In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The most the interesting thing I found in this video are the four stages of habit formation. 
These stages are:
- 1. Noticing (The Cue): Many people think they lack motivation when they actually lack clarity. First, step of habit formation is to figure what you need and its purpose. Also, determine how and when you will perform it.
- 2. Wanting (The Craving): The second step is to create an environment, which makes you more likely to perform your tiny habit. You will power alone won't be able to help you for long.
- 3. Doing (The Response): The third is to start performing it. Even if you are bad at it at the start, still keep doing it. Eventually, you will become better at it.
- 4. Liking (The Reward): Finally, celebrate your success. Don't wait for the final outcome. Give yourself little rewards.


## 4. Book Summary of Atomic Habits

#### What is the book's perspective about Identity?
The book's explains importance of identity in habit formation in these ways:
- Habit change operates on three layers: Outcomes (results), Processes (habits/systems), and Identity (beliefs).
- Most people work from outcome to identity (e.g., I want to lose weight, so I'll diet). Instead, you should work from identity to outcome. (e.g. "I am a healthy person. Therefore, as a healthy person, I will eat wholesome food and exercise regularly")
- This is important as when you identify yourself as the final outcome of your efforts, it becomes easier to follow your habits.

#### Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
These four steps of habit formation includes cue, craving, response, and reward. What you can do follow these steps is first, make it obvious by designing your environment to expose you to cues for good habits. Second, make it attractive by using temptation bundling to associate the habit with something you enjoy. Third, is to make it easy by reducing the friction/number of steps between you and the good behavior. Finally, make it immediately satisfying by attaching some form of immediate gratification to the habit.

#### Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
You make habit formation building process hard by following exactly opposite of steps of making it easier. The first one is to make it invisible, and not getting exposed to anything. Second, is to make it unattractive by doing it in a way that you don't enjoy. Third, is to make it hard by adding a lot of friction which make it hard to perform it in the first place. Finally, is to make it unsatisfying by not rewarding yourself each time you complete your tiny habits.


## 5. Reflection:

#### Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
The habit that I wish to inculcate in me would to exercise and jog every day. As, someone who working in the software industry we have a sedentary lifestyle. I wish to keep myself fit for the long run. To, stay fit I must start exercising and jogging daily. I will start with spending half an hour a day on it but will do it daily. The freshness of morning sunlight and sweat will be my reward.

#### Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
The one thing I must leave behind in eating unhealthy food. The easiest thing I can do is to stay away from the shops that sell junk food in the first place. I understand the harms that junk food eating will do to me and that makes me not wanting to eat them.
