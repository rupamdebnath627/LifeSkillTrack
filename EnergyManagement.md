# Energy Management


## 1. Manage Energy not Time

#### What are the activities you do that make you relax - Calm quadrant?
I do three things to relax myself:
- **Watching Documentaries:** When I feel stressed out, I start watching documentaries. I mostly watch documentaries regarding historical wars and geostrategic affairs.
- **Walking indoor:** To relax myself I often walk indoors and while thinking about places I can go for excursion.
- **Taking a short nap:** I short nap to calm myself down and regain some lost energy.

#### When do you find getting into the Stress quadrant?
Two things that give me the most amount of stress:
- **Vague instructions with strict deadline:** Whenever, I get into this kind of situation where I have vague objectives with strict deadlines to meet. I feel extremely stressed out.
- **Interacting with Conflict:** Another is when I have to engage in a high-stakes argument or confrontation that demands intense mental and emotional energy, leaving you exhausted and tense.

#### How do you understand if you are in the Excitement quadrant?
I understand this when I don't have put any effort while working on any activity. All I need to do is just go with flow. I don't look at time and I don't get distracted by anything.
